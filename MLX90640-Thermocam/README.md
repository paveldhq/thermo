# MLX90640-Thermocam

We built a simple Thermal camera using the MLX90640 Sensor, an ESP32, a ILI9341 TFT, a 18650 battery in a 3D printed case.
It was featured in Netzbasteln #111: http://www.netzbasteln.de/#111 and still lacks interpolation.

Code Based on:
- Thermal Camera with image saving capability https://github.com/wilhelmzeuschner/arduino_thermal_camera_with_sd_and_img_processing
- SparkFun MLX90640 Examples https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MLX90640_Arduino_Example
- TFT_eSPI Library: https://github.com/Bodmer/, important: copy the included TFT_eSPI/Setup_User.h into the librar folder.
